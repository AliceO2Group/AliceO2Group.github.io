The ALICE O2 Software is hosted on GitHub under the
[AliceO2Group](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/) organization.

Particularly relevant projects hosted there are the core package,
[AliceO2](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2), and the
[Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/CodingGuidelines).

If you want to join the project, make sure you follow the [AliPhysics basic
tutorial](http://alisw.github.io/git-tutorial/) which while thought for the old
version of ALICE Software still provides you the instructions on how to join
and get acquainted with git and GitHub.
