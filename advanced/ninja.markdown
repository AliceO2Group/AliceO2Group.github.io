Ninja
=====

Definition by its authors
---
Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible. (https://ninja-build.org/)

Ninja instead of make
--
Ninja can be used instead of make, in particular as a different generator in cmake. 

Usage in O2
--
Ninja will be used if you have ninja available in your PATH. And on Mac the easiest/fastest way to achieve this is `brew install ninja`.

Once you have ninja in your PATH, if you do not want to use it when `alibuilding` O2 or QC, you will need to export DISABLE_NINJA=1 beforehand.

Note that this only works for development packages.
