<strong>ALICE  (A  Large  Ion   Collider  Experiment)</strong>  is  a  general
purpose,  heavy ion  collision detector  at the  CERN LHC.  It is  designed to
study  the physics  of  strongly  interacting matter,  and  in particular  the
properties of  Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), using  proton-proton, nucleus-nucleus
and proton-nucleus collisions  at high energies. The ALICE  experiment will be
upgraded during the  Long Shutdown 2 (LS2, 2020-2021) in  order to exploit the
full  scientific potential  of  the future  LHC. Such  upgrade  will pose  the
challenge the challenge of reading out  and inspecting the Pb–Pb collisions at
rates of 50kHz, sampling  the pp and p–Pb at up to  200kHz. The resulting data
throughput from the  detector has been estimated to be  greater than 1TB/s for
Pb–Pb events, roughly two orders of magnitude more than in Run 2.

<strong>The  O2   software  framework</strong>  will  provide   the  necessary
abstraction  so that  common code  can deliver  the selected  functionality on
different platforms.  The framework will  also support a  concurrent computing
model for a wide spectrum of computing facilities, ranging from laptops to the
complete  O2 system.  Off-the-shelf open  source software  conforming to  open
standards will be  used as much as possible, either  for the development tools
or as a basis for the framework itself.
