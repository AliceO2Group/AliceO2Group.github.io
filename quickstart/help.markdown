JIRA
====
If you think you have found a bug in our software,
[report it here](https://alice.its.cern.ch). Change the issue
type from Bug to something else if appropriate.

Discourse
=========
For simple support questions [please use our Discourse forum](https://alice-talk.web.cern.ch/).

The first time you connect, you will need to hit the **Sign up** button and use your CERN
credentials to register. It is easy to browse existing topics in Discourse, and mark the relevant
reply as a solution. When you create a new discussion topic, Discourse suggests similar topics that
might be duplicates to your issue. Once a topic has been opened from the web interface, every
registered user gets an email notification. It is possible to reply to such emails directly from
your email client if you wish.

Mattermost
==========
To chat with other O2 developers we mostly use Mattermost. 

Go to https://mattermost.web.cern.ch, login with your CERN credentials and choose the Team "ALICE".
