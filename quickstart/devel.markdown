Since OÂ² uses the Git version control system it is recommended you follow [our AliPhysics Git
tutorial](http://alisw.github.io/git-tutorial/) to learn its rudiments.

Remember to [fork the AliceO2 project on GitHub](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/fork) and
please follow the [coding guidelines](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/CodingGuidelines/), given that
most of them are enforced by automatic checks.
